InlineScriptableObjects allows you to speed up your workflow by editing
ScriptableObjects of any type directly in the inspector of the object that
references them. This guide will help you getting started.

1. Decorate the ScriptableObject in the code with the [EditInline] attribute.
   e.g. [EditInline] public Character character;

2. Select the object you want to edit to display it in the Inspector.
   Due to a limitation of Unity, it can only be displayed correctly if a
   custom editor exists for the object the ScriptableObject is referenced
   in. Click the "Create one for me!" button to automatically create an
   empty implementation that is enough to display the inline editor.
   By default, a .cs file will be created in the Editor folder.

3. (optional) Your can move this file to another editor-only folder, e.g.
   a sub folder of the Editor folder or another folder called Editor that
   is located in a non-editor folder.

4. Reselect the object you want to edit. You are now able to inline edit
   your ScriptableObject! Feel free to examine the sample scene located
   in the Samples folder.

Known issues:
   - Creating the stub script could fail in rare cases.
     Workaround: Manually create an editor script that inherits from 
     UnityEditor.Editor and add the Attribute [CustomEditor(typeof(MyType))]
     to it.
   - Custom editors in imported .dll libraries are not supported and
     recognized at the moment.
