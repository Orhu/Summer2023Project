Generic Trapper Behavior is as Follows:

Wander randomly around the room until some wander duration is met, then lay a trap. 
After laying a trap, wander again.
At any point, the flee state can be entered if the player walks within range of the trapper.

Movement: Wander
Targeting: None

This example Trapper is simply a Bear Trapper.

To create a new enemy:
Create a new folder named whatever enemy you want. Then, create folders "Animation", "Projectile", and "States" to mirror the Generic folder structure.
Right click GenericWanderingRanged > Deep Copy, a popup will appear. Send the deep copy to the path of your newly created folder.
	* Animations holds animation controllers, animations, sprites, etc.
	* States holds all state/logic related ScriptableObjects
	* (Optional) Projectile holds all projectile sprites, BulletAttack/OrbitAttack and their related objects. 
			            If there are multiple projectiles that can be fired, give them each their own folder.

You might want to use Tools > Batch Rename to easily find/replace names of the newly deep copied Generic Wandering Ranged.

Add your sprite to the prefab, and modify the outer hitbox on the prefab to fit its damageable region.
Then, go into the feet child object and modify that hitbox to fit its waist/feet. 
    * Feet should be as small as possible while still fitting the visual of the enemy. 
    * Feet should never exceed 1 tile in size, otherwise the enemy will likely get stuck on obstacles very easily.

Modify the states and actions as needed. You can find all created state machine things under Right Click > Create > FSM.
Stats such as health, movement speed, on touch damage, etc can all be found on the prefab itself.
