Generic Pest Behavior is as Follows:

Target Random Tile, Chase Target repeatedly. 
By default, the cooldown for acquiring a new target & moving is 4 seconds. 
These cooldowns are easy to adjust via the provided ChaseTarget and TargetRandomTile actions.

Movement: Wander
Targeting: None

This example Generic Pest is simply a Rat.

To create a new enemy:
Right click GenericPest > Create > Prefab Variant

Place it in its folder, alongside a folder called "Animations", "States", and optionally "Projectile"
	Animations holds animation controllers, animations, sprites, etc.
	States holds all state/logic related ScriptableObjects
	(Optional) Projectile holds all projectile sprites, BulletAttack/OrbitAttack and their related objects. 
			If there are multiple projectiles that can be fired, give them each their own folder.

Add your sprite, and modify the outer hitbox on the prefab to fit its damageable region.
Then, go into the feet child object and modify that hitbox to fit its waist/feet. 
    * Feet should be as small as possible while still fitting the visual of the enemy. 
    * Feet should never exceed 1 tile in size, otherwise the enemy will likely get stuck on obstacles very easily.

Modify the states and actions as needed. You can find all created state machine things under Right Click > Create > FSM.
Stats such as health, movement speed, on touch damage, etc can all be found on the prefab itself.
